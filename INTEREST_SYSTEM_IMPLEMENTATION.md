# Interest System Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Backend Infrastructure
- **Interests Model**: Created `interests.model.ts` with client/company relationships and status tracking
- **Repository Layer**: Implemented `interests.repository.ts` with full CRUD operations
- **Controller**: Created `interests.controller.ts` with all required endpoints
- **Routes**: Added `interests.routes.ts` with role-based access control
- **Database**: Applied migration to create interests table

### 2. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/interests/express/:clientId` - Companies express interest (with auth)
- `GET /api/interests/my` - Companies view their expressed interests
- `GET /api/interests/received` - Clients view interests received
- `GET /api/interests/unread-count` - Clients get unread notification count
- `PATCH /api/interests/:interestId/read` - Clients mark interests as read
- `PATCH /api/interests/:interestId/status` - Clients accept/reject interests

### 3. Frontend Components
- **JobBrowsing Component**: Enhanced with "Mark as Interested" functionality
  - Shows existing expressions of interest
  - Loading states during interest expression
  - Both "Mark as Interested" and "Email Client" options
- **InterestNotifications Component**: Complete notification system for clients
  - Shows all received interests with company details
  - Unread count and visual indicators
  - Accept/reject functionality
  - Mark as read functionality

### 4. Integration
- **CompanyDashboard**: Added tabs for "Company Profile" and "Browse Projects"
- **Service Layer**: Updated `jobBrowsing.service.ts` with all interest endpoints
- **Test Routes**: 
  - `/test/job-browsing` - Test company job browsing
  - `/test/notifications` - Test client notifications

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
interests (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id INTEGER REFERENCES clients(id),
  company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
  status 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected' DEFAULT 'pending',
  message TEXT,
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### Key Features
1. **Role-based Access**: Companies can express interest, clients can manage them
2. **Status Management**: Pending â†’ Accepted/Rejected workflow
3. **Notification System**: Unread counts and visual indicators
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Companies can't express interest twice
5. **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI feedback on all actions

### Error Handling
- Proper error messages for duplicate interests
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Loading states for all async operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## ðŸš€ How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Backend running on `http://localhost:5000`
2. Frontend running on `http://localhost:5174`
3. User authenticated with company role for job browsing
4. User authenticated with client role for notifications

### Test Scenarios

#### As a Company User:
1. Visit `/company/dashboard` and click "Browse Projects" tab
2. See available client projects with descriptions
3. Click "Mark as Interested" on any project
4. Should see confirmation and button change to "Interest Expressed"
5. Can still use "Email Client" for direct contact

#### As a Client User:
1. Visit `/test/notifications` (or integrate into client dashboard)
2. See all company interests with details
3. Click "Mark as read" to remove unread indicator
4. Use "Accept" or "Reject" buttons to respond to interests
5. See real-time status updates

#### Additional Testing:
- Direct component testing at `/test/job-browsing`
- Check duplicate interest prevention
- Verify role-based access restrictions
